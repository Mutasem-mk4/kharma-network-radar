## 👁️ What is Kharma?

Traditional network monitoring on Linux/Windows requires manually chaining `netstat`, `grep`, `lsof`, and external IP checkers. This is slow and tedious during an incident response.

**Kharma** acts as an all-seeing eye for your operating system. It provides a stunning, high-performance radar that intercepts outbound connections, unmasks the executable initiating the socket, runs the file against 70+ Anti-Virus engines in the cloud, and plots the destination IP on a map—all updated every 2 seconds.

## 🔥 Elite Features

- 🌐 **Web UI Dashboard (New in v5.0):** Spawns a hidden Flask backend serving a beautiful, dark-themed HTML/JS Dashboard. View live connections, Geo-locations, and kill malware right from your browser.
- 🦠 **Enterprise EDR (VirusTotal):** Natively extracts the physical binary path of connected processes (`.exe` / ELF), computes its SHA-256 hash locally, and verifies it against VirusTotal limits.
- ⚔️ **Active Defense (Auto-Kill IPS):** Instantly terminates any process the millisecond it initiates a connection to a known malicious IP (Firehol blocklist) or a flagged binary hash.
- 📡 **Offline Geo-IP Engine:** Built-in `MaxMind GeoLite2` database ensures **0ms lag** when resolving IP coordinates. No external rate limits, 100% privacy.
- 🗄️ **Time Machine Logger:** Silently records all established connections to a local SQLite database (`~/.kharma/kharma_history.db`) for post-incident forensics.
- 🤖 **Background Daemon & Telegram Alerts:** Run `kharma daemon start` to deploy a headless background worker that watches traffic quietly and pushes critical breach alerts dynamically to Telegram.
