## 👁️ What is Kharma?

Traditional network monitoring on Linux/Windows requires manually chaining `netstat`, `grep`, `lsof`, and external IP checkers. This is slow and tedious during an incident response.

**Kharma** acts as an all-seeing eye for your operating system. It provides a stunning, high-performance radar that intercepts outbound connections, unmasks the executable initiating the socket, runs the file against 70+ Anti-Virus engines in the cloud, and plots the destination IP on a map—all updated every 2 seconds.

## 🔥 Elite Features

- 🌐 **Web UI Dashboard (New in v5.0):** Spawns a hidden Flask backend serving a beautiful, dark-themed HTML/JS Dashboard. View live connections, Geo-locations, and kill malware right from your browser.
- 🦠 **Enterprise EDR (VirusTotal):** Natively extracts the physical binary path of connected processes (`.exe` / ELF), computes its SHA-256 hash locally, and verifies it against VirusTotal limits.
- ⚔️ **Active Defense (Auto-Kill IPS):** Instantly terminates any process the millisecond it initiates a connection to a known malicious IP (Firehol blocklist) or a flagged binary hash.
- 📡 **Offline Geo-IP Engine:** Built-in `MaxMind GeoLite2` database ensures **0ms lag** when resolving IP coordinates. No external rate limits, 100% privacy.
- 🗄️ **Time Machine Logger:** Silently records all established connections to a local SQLite database (`~/.kharma/kharma_history.db`) for post-incident forensics.
- 🤖 **Background Daemon & Telegram Alerts:** Run `kharma daemon start` to deploy a headless background worker that watches traffic quietly and pushes critical breach alerts dynamically to Telegram.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Kharma is designed for maximum performance, minimal dependencies, and absolute oversight.

- **Frontend:** `rich` (Terminal TUI) & `Tailwind.css + JavaScript` (Web UI).
- **Backend Core:** `psutil` (Socket Hooks), `Flask` (REST API).
- **Persistence:** Local `SQLite` for logging and `.mmdb` for GeoIP lookups.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### 1. "'pip' or 'kharma' is not recognized..." (Windows)
This means Python is not in your System PATH.
- **Fix:** Re-install Python and check **"Add Python to PATH"** in the installer.
- **Quick Workaround:** Use `python -m pip install kharma-radar` and `python -m kharma`.

### 2. "Python was not found..."
You might have the "Windows App Execution Aliases" enabled.
- **Fix:** Go to **Manage App Execution Aliases** in Windows settings and turn **OFF** the aliases for `python.exe` and `python3.exe`.
